  "ODEC_SOFTARE_DEVELOP_DESCRIPTION": "I started developing software in a mobility project, where an Android application was created, using Android Studio, and we used JAVA as the application language. Then I entered another project that consisted of a web development from 0. In this project we used AngularJS (1.6) for front-end and JAVA for back-end, in which we used several patterns, including dependency injection and layered programming. It also incorporated Spring and Hibernate for data persistence and as an ORM. As for the database, MYSQL was used, and I was doing full-stack and DevOps tasks, creating the new functionalities, maintenance and deployments. Then I went into other projects of shorter duration where I used SQL, JSF, JSP...",

  "GUD_SOFTARE_DEVELOP_DESCRIPTION": "During my work at Green Urban Data I learned many things such as hexagonal architecture (DDD), unit and e2e testing with methodologies such as TDD, good practices and clean code, among many other things. I focused on complete tasks for the development of new functionalities (front, back, servers or database). The main technologies used were docker and docker-compose where we contained the web, Angular on the front with Cypress for the e2e test, Laravel on the back and PostgreSQL for the database. For all this we used the AWS servers. Another thing to note is the implementation of CI/CD with the use of CircleCI, which together with git allowed us the continuous and secure value setting.",

I studied systems administration and web development, so I can do any type of tasks, I love programming and I always like to learn the latest technologies. I believe that a good job is not only that it works, but that from the inside it is well structured, efficient and of course scalable and without failures. The languages I use the most are Javascript with Angular, PHP with Laravel and JAVA along with Spring and Hibernate, as for the databases I have used MySql, PostgreSQL and SQLite, and I have experience in AWS. All this together with good development practices, Hexagonal architecture and testing knowledge makes it possible to develop safely and with continuous integration without problems.",
